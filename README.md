# minesweeper
### Simple minesweeper game in .NET Core using WPF.

This project was created for two purposes - first, to show a basic knowledge and proficiency with C# for recruiters, and second, to help me get more experience with WPF. I had only created one or two projects previously with WPF, and a lot of this project was learning best practices for implementing the MVVM structural design pattern and understanding .xaml layouts.
